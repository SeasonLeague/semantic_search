1. Formalize the problem
 - What data do i need
 - What tools do i need 
 - How will i approach/solve the problem 
	- The methodology, 
	- data preprocessing techniques,
	- model selection, 
	- and evaluation metrics employed to construct the ARIMA model
 - How will I test/confirm my result 
 - Literature 

2. Write things down in form of an introduction 
3. Introduction = A more detailed proposal
